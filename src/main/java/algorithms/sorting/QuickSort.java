/**
 * @author Bipin Jadaun
 * Quicksort leverages the "divide-and-conquer" principle.
 * An element from the array is used as pivot to divide the list into two sub-lists.
 * The elements from the array are reordered in such a way that â€“
 * The smaller elements are placed left to pivot, and greater elements are placed right.
 * After this step, the pivot is in its sorted position. This is the important partition step.
 * The above steps used recursively on both sub arrays on the left and right of the pivot.
 * It's an "In-place" but "Un-Stable" sorting algorithm. It has an  O(nlogn) time complexity.
